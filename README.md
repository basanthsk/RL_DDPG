## Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommender System in Pytorch
In this project, we aim to implement a deep reinforcement learning based recommender system, inspired by the paper [Deep Reinforcement Learning based Recommendation with Explicit User-Item Interactions Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12027) by Liu et al. We use the [DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) algorithm, which combines actor-critic and deterministic policy gradient methods, to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward for recommending items to users. To handle the high-dimensional and sparse user-item interaction data, we add a state representation module that transforms the data into a trainable state vector for the RL algorithm. This is not the official implementation of the paper, but our own attempt to reproduce and extend their work.

 We use an actor network with an embedding layer to learn the optimal policy for recommending items to users. We also address the issue of overestimating the Q values by applying a double Q-learning algorithm. Furthermore, we leverage several pretrained embeddings to capture the semantic and contextual information of the items and users. Finally, we employ a prioritized experience replay ([PER])(https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952) technique to sample more informative transitions from the replay buffer.
